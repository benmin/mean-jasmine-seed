# angular-express-jasmine
This seed is a great starting point for developing a web app with AngularJS on the front end and NodeJS/Express on the back end.

Key features:
- It is configured with Jasmine and Karma to test both the client- and server-side javascript.
- Many grunt tasks are already configured: linting, minifying, unit testing, moving code to a 'dist' directory, etc.
- It doesn't use Jade (which is default with Express projects) as a templating language. Given that Angular already has its own templating, I decided it would be less confusing if there wasn't another templating language on top of it.
